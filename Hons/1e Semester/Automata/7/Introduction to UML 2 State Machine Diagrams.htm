                  <P class=MsoNormal>UML state machine diagrams depict the 
                  various states that an object may be in and the transitions 
                  between those states. In fact, in other modeling languages, it 
                  is common for this type of a diagram to be called a 
                  state-transition diagram or even simply a state diagram. A 
                  state represents a stage in the behavior pattern of an object, 
                  and like <A 
                  href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/activityDiagram.htm">UML 
                  activity diagrams</A> it is possible to have initial states 
                  and final states. An initial state, also called a creation 
                  state, is the one that an object is in when it is first 
                  created, whereas a final state is one in which no transitions 
                  lead out of. A transition is a progression from one state to 
                  another and will be triggered by an event that is either 
                  internal or external to the object. </P>
                  <P class=MsoNormal><A 
                  href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/stateMachineDiagram.htm#Figure1">Figure 
                  1</A> presents an example state machine diagram for the 
                  <I>Seminar</I> class during registration. The rounded 
                  rectangles represent states: you see that instances of 
                  <I>Seminar</I> can be in the <I>Proposed</I>, 
                  <I>Scheduled</I>, <I>Open For Enrollment</I>, <I>Full</I>, and 
                  <I>Closed to Enrollment</I> states. An object starts in an 
                  initial state, represented by the closed circle, and can end 
                  up in a final state, represented by the bordered circle. This 
                  is the exact same notation used by UML activity diagrams, a 
                  perfect example of the consistency of the UML.</P>

                  1</A> represent transitions, progressions from one state to 
                  another. For example, when a seminar is in the 
                  <I>Scheduled</I> state, it can either be opened for enrollment 
                  or cancelled. 
                  &nbsp;<!--[if supportFields]>&nbsp;T<![endif]-->he notation 
                  for the labels on transitions is in the format <I>event 
                  [guard][/method list]</I>.&nbsp; It is mandatory to indicate 
                  the event which causes the transition, such as <I>open</I> or 
                  <I>cancelled</I>.&nbsp; Guard, conditions that must be true 
                  for the transition to be triggered, are optionally indicated. 
                  The <I>[not seat available]</I> guard is shown on the 
                  <I>student enrolled</I> transition from the <I>Open For 
                  Enrollment</I> to the <I>Closed To Enrollment</I> state.&nbsp; 
                  Guards can be described in any manner, including both free 
                  form text or formal language – when I’m <A 
                  href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/whiteboardModeling.htm">whiteboarding</A> 
                  I’ll use free form text to ensure that it’s readable by 
                  everyone but with a sophisticated CASE tool I would consider 
                  using either a programming language such as Java or a modeling 
                  language such as <A 
                  href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/constraint.htm">Object 
                  Constraint Language (OCL)</A> if the tool has the ability to 
                  actually process that information into something useful (such 
                  as executable code). The invocation of methods, such as 
                  <I>addToWaitingList()</I> can optionally be indicated on 
                  transitions. The order in the listing implying the order in 
                  which they are invoked. </P>
                  <P class=MsoNormal>States are represented by the values of the 
                  attributes of an object. For example, a seminar is in the 
                  <I>Open For Enrollment</I> state when it has been flagged as 
                  open and seats are available to be filled.&nbsp; It is 
                  possible to indicate the invocation of methods within a state, 
                  for example, upon entry into the <I>Closed To Enrollment</I> 
                  state the method <I>notifyInstructor()</I> is invoked. The 
                  notation used within the same as that used on transitions, the 
                  only difference being that the method list is mandatory and 
                  the event is optional.&nbsp; For example in the <I>Full</I> 
                  state the operations <I>addToWaitingList()</I> and 
                  <I>considerSplit()</I> are invoked whenever a student is 
                  enrolled.&nbsp; Had there been no event indicated those 
                  methods would be invoked continuously (in a loop) whenever the 
                  object is in that state. I indicate the methods to run during 
                  the state when I want to indicate a method is to be run 
                  continuously, perhaps a method that polls other objects for 
                  information or a method that implements the logic of an 
                  important business process.&nbsp; Methods to be invoked when 
                  the object enters the state are indicated by the keyword 
                  <I>entry</I>, as you see with both the <I>Open For 
                  Enrollment</I> and <I>Closed To Enrollment</I> states in <A 
                  href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/stateMachineDiagram.htm#Figure1">Figure 
                  1</A>. Methods to be invoked as the object exits the state are 
                  indicated by the keyword <I>exit</I>. The capability to 
                  indicate method invocations when you enter and exit a state is 
                  useful because it enables you to avoid documenting the same 
                  method several times on each of the transitions that enter or 
                  exit the state, respectively. </P>
                  <P class=MsoNormal>Transitions are the result of the 
                  invocation of a method that causes an important change in 
                  state. Understanding that not all method invocations will 
                  result in transitions is important. For example, the 
                  invocation of a getter method likely wouldn’t cause a 
                  transition because it isn’t changing the state of the object 
                  (unless lazy initialization is being applied). Furthermore, <A 
                  href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/stateMachineDiagram.htm#Figure1">Figure 
                  1</A> indicates an attempt to enroll a student in a full 
                  seminar may not result in the object changing state, unless it 
                  is determined that the seminar should be split, even though 
                  the state of the object changes (another student is added to 
                  the waiting list). You can see that transitions are a 
                  reflection of your business rules. For example, you see that 
                  you can attempt to enroll a student in a course only when it 
                  is open for enrollment or full, and that a seminar may be 
                  split (presumably into two seminars) when the waiting list is 
                  long enough to justify the split. You can have recursive 
                  transitions, also called self transitions, that start and end 
                  in the same state. &nbsp;An example of which is the <I>student 
                  dropped</I> transition when the seminar is full.</P>
                  <P class=MsoNormal>For the sake of convention, we say an 
                  object is always in one and only one state, implying 
                  transitions are instantaneous. Although we know this is not 
                  completely true (every method is going to take some time to 
                  run), this makes life a lot easier for us to assume 
                  transitions take no time to complete.</P>
                  <P class=MsoNormal>Because the lifecycle of a seminar is so 
                  complex <A

                  and <I>Model in Small Increments</I>.&nbsp; In fact, instead

                  4</A> depicts a slightly different take on state machine 
                  diagrams, this time it is much closer to an analysis level 
                  diagram because it shows what is happening to the seminar 
                  while it is in this state from the point of view of the people 
                  involved.&nbsp; It is organized into two parallel swimlanes 
                  representing parallel substates – one from the point of view 
                  of the professor teaching the seminar and the other showing 
                  the actions of the teaching assistant responsible for keeping 
                  the seminar material up to date.&nbsp; Concurrent substates 
                  are common with hardware but very uncommon in business 
                  classes, hence the goofy example.&nbsp; Normally I would

                  <I>Break Starts</I> transition exiting from the <I>Being 
                  Taught</I> states is applicable to all of the substates, you 
                  know this because it exits from the superstate instead of an 
                  individual substate.&nbsp; The <I>Work Submitted</I> 
                  transition is potentially triggered by several sources, you 
                  know this because it is attached to the outside edge of the 
                  superstate, whereas the source of the <I>Break ends</I> 
                  transition is explicitly defined as the <I>School Break</I> 
                  state. The initial transition into this state is the <I>Term 
                  Started</I> transition, indicated through the use of an 
                  initial state symbol.&nbsp; I could also have modeled this 
                  state coming from an <I>Enrollment</I> state, either approach 
                  is fair.&nbsp; </P>
                  <P class=MsoNormal>The <I>Term Started</I> and <I>Break 
                  Ends</I> transitions are first merged, then they lead to a 
                  fork which in turn leads to one or the other set of concurrent 
                  substates.&nbsp; A history pseudo-state is shown, the circle 
                  with the <I>H</I>, indicating that if <I>Seminar</I> was 
                  previously in this state, left it, and the returns that it 
                  will go back to the substate it was originally in.&nbsp; The 
                  arrow leaving the history pseudo state indicates that the 
                  <I>Deliver Course Material</I> substate is the default the 
                  very first time that <I>Seminar</I> enters the <I>Begin

                  <H3>Drawing State Machine Diagrams</H3>
                  <P class=MsoNormal>When drawing a state machine diagram the 
                  thing you want to do is to identify the creation state and 
                  whether any final states exist. &nbsp;After you have done 
                  this, ask yourself what other states or stages in the life of 
                  an object does it pass through? You can often find states by 
                  looking at the boundary values of your attributes. For 
                  example, when the number of students in a seminar reaches the 
                  maximum, it becomes full. <I>Full</I> is a valid state because 
                  different rules now apply: when a student tries to enroll, he 
                  is put on a waiting list and the seminar is a candidate to be 
                  split in two.</P>
                  <P class=MsoNormal>Once you have identified as many states as 
                  you can, start looking for transitions. For each state, ask 
                  yourself how the object can get out of it, if possible. This 
                  will give you a transition. Because all transitions lead from 
                  one state to another, ask yourself what new state the 
                  transition leads you to (don’t forget about recursive 
                  transitions that lead to the same state).&nbsp; You should 
                  also look at the methods you identified in your class diagram. 
                  Some of them will correspond to a transition in your state 
                  diagram.</P>
                  <P class=MyTip>Identifying potential error conditions while 
                  you are state machine modeling is common because you are 
                  constantly asking “should this transition be allowed when the 
                  object is in this state?” When the answer is yes, you need to 
                  add the transition to your diagram. When the answer&nbsp; is 
                  no, you may need to document this potential issue so your 
                  programmers develop the proper error checking code, so the 
                  transition is not allowed to occur.</P>
                  <P class=MsoNormal>Although being able to inherit state 
                  diagrams would be nice, it is extremely unlikely this will 
                  happen. The definition of inheritance says that although the 
                  subclass is similar to the superclass, it is still different. 
                  The behavior of the subclass is usually different than that of 
                  the superclass. This means you need to reconsider the state 
                  diagram when you inherit from a class with one. The one good 
                  thing is many of the states and transitions are reusable. You 
                  will probably find you either add new states and transitions, 
                  or you will redefine some. </P>

                  <H3>Remaining Agile</H3>
                  <P class=MsoNormal>State machine modeling is a dynamic 
                  modeling technique, one that focuses on identifying the 
                  behavior within your system<SPAN 
                  style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol">¾</SPAN>in this case, behavior 
                  specific to the instances of a single class. My style is to 
                  draw one or more state machine diagrams when a class exhibits 
                  different behavior depending on its state. For example, the 
                  <I>Address</I> class is fairly simple, representing data you 
                  will display and manipulate in your system. <I>Seminar</I> 
                  objects, on the other hand, are fairly complex, and therefore 
                  it makes sense to create a state machine diagram for them. 
</P>
                  <P class=MsoNormal>In business applications it seems that a 
                  very small proportion of classes, perhaps 5% at most, are 
                  complex enough to warrant the creation of a state machine 
                  diagram.&nbsp; However, state machine diagrams are much more 
                  common in real-time systems (<A
