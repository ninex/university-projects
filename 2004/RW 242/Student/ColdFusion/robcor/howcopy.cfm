<h1 align="center">How to copy your files to the web server</h1>



<ol>

  <li>First, you need to create your pages using a standard text editor such as Notepad.exe or

    if you prefer, you could use a HTML editor such as FrontPage, AOLPress, etc.

  </li>

  <li>After you have created your page, you need to upload your pages to the Web server

    directories. To do this you will need to have:<ol type="a">

      <li>an FTP Client program and,</li>

      <li>an userid and password. Please ask your teacher for this information.</li>

    </ol>

  </li>

  <li>Obtaining a FTP client program. We recommend using some shareware or 
  freeware FTP clients available on the Internet or in your school site. 

  </li>

  <li>To configure your FTP client to access the Web Server directory you need to enter the

    following information in the FTP connection window (we are using WS_FTP32 client):<br>
  <br>

    Description: Any text you want<br>

    Host&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :&nbsp;the IP address or domain

    name of the web server (consult your teacher), in our example ntdemo.mtsu.edu<br>

    User ID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : the userid assigned to you by your teacher, in our

    example we use isuer01<br>

    Password&nbsp; : your assigned password<br>

    system using the arrow keys, &quot;--&gt;&quot;. For example, to send a file in your a:

    drive, you will:<ul>

      <li>click on the [-a-] icon under local system, </li>

      <li>a list of files in your a: drive disk will appear</li>

      <li>select the file you want to send by single clicking on it, </li>

      <li>to send the file over to the remote system, just click on the [--&gt;] arrow . </li>

      <li>The file will be saved in the /infs490/iuser01 directory.<br>

      </li>

    </ul>

  </li>

  <li>You can use the command buttons to the right of the directory lists to view, rename or,

    delete files on the local or remote system.<br>
